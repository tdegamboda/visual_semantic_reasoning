We have two forms of notebooks available in this repo. The Google colab notebooks which have the toy problems and the other notebooks containg the experiments on the Tractable dataset. For the Google Colab notebooks if you wish to run the experiments some notebooks will require you to mount the Drive in the notebook. To do this I have created a throw-away google Drive account that countains the datasets required to run these notebooks.

Likewise the notebooks containing our Tractable experiments have been cleared of any outputs containing any form personal information belonging to Tractable or any of their clients.
